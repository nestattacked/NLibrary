1._DEBUG_ can be used to test program and at the same time we can make program efficient, so remember to use it.

how to organize our library?
project/app.cpp
project/nlib/lib-name/lib-files

how to use?
in app.cpp:
#include "nlib/lib-name/lib-head-file.h"

nlib::lib-name::function(argument);

and what else?
we need a tool to generate a makefile and download lib files from server.

how to give a name?
function:
doSomething()
value:
type_of_value
class:
CarWheel

what's the rule of library?
使用c标准库而不是c++的
之所以采用c++语言是因为我们需要c++的类、模板等机制
